    <h1>Qyint Decision Making Process</h1>
    <div class="noti-box">
      <h1>Note:</h1>
      <p>Some Processes might be changed in the Future. Licensing will never change.</p>
    </div>
    <h1>Question</h1>
    <p><i>How do Questions get introduced to the Staff Team in the first place?</i>
    <br>If a Staff Member sends a Question to the Administrators, it cannot be declined.
    <br>If a User wants to change something, they may request a Change to the Staff Team.
    <br>Staff may decline a Request by a regular User.
    </p>
    <h1>Election</h1>
    <p><i>Who is allowed to make Decisions?</i>
    <br>There are differend Kinds of Elections.
    <br>Administrator Elections (only Admins vote)
    <br>Staff Elections (the entire Staff Team votes)
    <br>Administrator Elections last for a Week or until all Administrators have voted.
    <br>Staff Elections last for two Weeks or until all Staff Members have voted.
    <br>Anyone may start a Poll, for example on Discord, to ask for the Users Opinions.
    <br>Staff can decide for themselves if they want to abide by the Peoples Rule or make their own Decision.
    </p>
    <h1>§1 - Staff Team</h1>
    <p><i>How is the Staff Team built? ...</i>
    <br>Administrators may decide to promote a User to a Staff Position.
    <br>Such a Request will be voted on by the Administrators.
    <br>If 2/3 of the Administrator Team decide to promote a User to a Position, they will be promoted.
    <br>Any User may request the Demotion of a Staff Member, this will also be voted on by the Administrators with a 2/3 Majority deciding.
    <br>Such a Request may not be declined.
    <br>
    <br>Administrators may decide to promote a Staff Member to an Administrator Position.
    <br>Such a Request will be voted on by the entire Staff Team.
    <br>100% of the Staff Team have to vote in favor of the Promotion for them to be admitted into the Position.
    </p>
    <h1>§2 - Punishments</h1>
    <p><i>How is a Punishment decided on? ...</i>
    <br>Moderators and higher-positioned Staff Members decide on a Punishment.
    <br>Administrators may decide to change a Punishment, for example by revoking a Ban. (It is the punished Users responsibility to message Administrators about appeals)
    <br>If Administrators cannot decide on what Punishment is valid, it will be voted on by the entire Staff Team.
    <br>Only Administrators may delete a Users Data (as in Data stored on Qyint Servers) after voting on it with a 2/3 Majority.
    </p>
    <h1>§3 - Service Management</h1>
    <p><i>Who owns the Qyint Servers? ...</i>
    <br>The Maintainer of a Service owns 100% of it. (Unless they, for example, share it with another Maintainer.) Usually the Administrators maintain every Qyint Service.
    <br>Services not maintained by Administrators have to be marked as such.
    <br>Note: We can never guarantee the Stability or Security of our own Services, but we try to keep good Security practices.
    <br>We will never share your Data with third parties or use it for malicious purposes.
    <br>How youre gonna know? Never. We could share the Data we collect, which is only what you share, at any Moment, but we promise not to.
    <br>Honesty is important. You have no reason to trust us.
    </p>
    <h1>§4 - Repository Management</h1>
    <p><i>How are changes decided on?</i>
    <br>The Creator of a Repository in the Qyint-Community Github is the Owner. (Unless they, for example, transfer Ownership.)
    <br>There are two Ways to permit a Change to a Repository.
    <br>Option 1: Through the Staff Team
    <br>Just like any other Decision, a Change requested by the Staff Team will be decided on.
    <br>Note: Important Decisions (such as Security Updates) will only be decided on by the Administrators.
    <br>Finally, if the Decision passes through the Staff Team, the Maintainer of the Respository may decide to approve or deny the Change.
    <br>Option 2: Through the Maintainer
    <br>The Maintainer may decide to accept a Change.
    <br>But the Change can be rejected retrospectively by the Staff Team.
    <br>If a Maintainer decides to push malicious Updates or does not listen to the Majority Vote of the Staff Team, they may be sanctioned.
    <br>Sancions may be decided on by the Administrators.
    <br>Note: Fixing Typos does not require authorisation.
