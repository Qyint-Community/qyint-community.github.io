    <h1>May Day - Painting the World Red in RISK!</h1>
    <h3>ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡³ [Events] @ 30.04.2023</h3>
    <h2>Risk Event</h2>
    <p>On May Day, you can play Risk with other Members from the Community. This Event is organized by Lanina and in Parts by mish.<br>
    Voice Chat is completely optional and will probably not be used, as were all on 3 different Platforms! Everything will be organized through the DE and EN Chats and the News Channel!<br>
    As always, this Event is democratic. If the Majority wants to change something about how we play, we will.<br>Have fun!</p>
    <h2>May 1st, May Day</h2>
    <p>On this Day in 1886, american Labor Unions called for General Strike. They wanted an eight-hour Work Day, instead of the previous twelve.<br>
    Ever since, May Day was recognized as an important Day in leftist History.<br>
    In Germany, der "Tag der Arbeit" or "Maifaiertag" was first introduced by the Weimar Government for 1919;<br>
    The Nazis later appropriated this Holiday, as they did with many leftist Symbols. But it didnt have much in common with the actual May Day.<br>
    The Soviets and the West reintroduced the actual May Day in Germany after the second World War.</p>
