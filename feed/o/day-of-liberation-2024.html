    <h1>Day of Liberation 2024</h1>
    <h3>ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡³ [Info] @ 08.05.2024</h3>
    <h2>Flags and Music BANNED on the Day of Liberation from Fascism and War in Berlin:</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Today...</b><br>
		on the Day of Liberation, just like last Year, it is illegal to display the Flags of the Soviet Union in Berlin.<br>
		Its also illegal to carry the russian Tricolor or to sing russian Songs about the Victory against Hitler.<br><br>
		And all that in the Name of Peace!<br>
		These Symbols - especially today, for some inexplicable Reason - "glorify the War against Ukraine"<br><br>
		This [Ban] includes this well-known Picture of a Red Soldier waving the Flag of Victory over the Reichstag, photographed by a <i>ukrainian</i> Soldier:<br><br>
		<img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1167595150088867890/1237723707510620173/Raising_a_flag_over_the_Reichstag.png?ex=663caf87&is=663b5e07&hm=413617bcaec34ca6bf190e040e590cadb01861f7f14a305cedff87a20d3c7af8&=&format=webp&quality=lossless" style="width:100%;"></img><br><br>
		The Flags of the western Allies, however, remain legal, even though they rejected the soviet Proposal of a unified, democratic, demilitarized and neutral Germany - just like in Austria.<br>
		They divided the german People and dragged them into a Cold War. Even today, the West is not innocent. Why then are only russian Flags banned? And why ban any Flags in the first Place?<br><br>
		Glory and Gratitude to all Soldiers, Partisans and Workers who liberated us from Fascism and War!<br>
		Down with the Warmongers, who distort History and even justify it with Peace!<br><br>
		Against a Ban on Flags and Music!<br>
		Against this Restriction of Freedom of Speech and Assembly!<br><br>
