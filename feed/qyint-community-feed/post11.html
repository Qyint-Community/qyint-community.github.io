    <h3>ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡³ [Community Updates] @ 18.08.2023</h3>
    <p>
        I decided to stop writing this, but Im gonna post the Draft anyway.<br>
        Address to the Qyint Community at the bottom.<br>

    <p>
        Over the last couple of Months I have noticed many Problems with Revolt<br>
        This is not something only I have an Issue with - many Users faced similar Problems. So I decided to list a few of them in this Thread.<br>
        These are just a couple of Examples and I wont talk about every single Thing.<br>
        Im a firm Believer of 'People can think for themselves.'<br>
        Information should be free for everyone to access.
    </p>

    <h2>I. Double Standards & Favouritism</h2>
    
    <h3>A. Illegal Content</h3>
    <p>
      The Revolt <a href="https://revolt.chat/aup">AUP</a> clearly states: <i>(as of 15.08.)</i><br><br>
      
      <i>"<b>What We Don't Allow</b><br> [...] Using Revolt for illegal operations. These include, but are not limited to, hacking, the cracking or <b>distribution of pirated software,</b> [...] for our or another company or person's service."</i><br><br>
      
      Then how come Team Member Lea <i>(@Lea#5128)</i> is allowed to share a Link to her pirated Nintendo Games <a href="https://imgur.com/a/cy6omqX">in her Bio?</a><br>
      Well, we kinda got an Answer from the Moderator Vale <i>(@Vale#0210)</i> <a href="https://imgur.com/a/7sHhrOV">right here.</a><br>
      But if Hosting is the Problem - and not the Distribution (which a Link to the Website is, no?) - how come my Youtube Link <a href="https://imgur.com/a/mCqchZN">gets deleted from my Bio?</a>
    </p>

    <h3>B. "No Politics!"</h3>
    <p>
      The <a href="https://rvlt.gg/RXJK3m0H">Revolt Lounge</a>s Rules <i>(as of 15.08.)</i> include Rule 3:<br><br>
      
      <i>"Unless directly related to Revolt, please avoid any politics discussion on this server."</i><br><br>
      
      Now, I wouldnt even know how to enforce such a Rule.<br>
      Politics is fighting over Peoples Interests, or as others would define it: <i>"the total complex of relations between people living in society"</i><br>
      So where do you draw the Line between a normal and a political Conversation?<br>
      Free & Open-Source, for example, is an inherently leftist and thus political Concept.<br><br>

      Anyway, if Politics arent allowed and I keep getting warned for it, how come Staff is allowed to <a href="https://imgur.com/a/qDLUIoC">insult an entire Group of People for their Political Position</a> while we were talking about Apes?<br><br>

      I also dont see how it is okay to <a href="https://imgur.com/a/ybxP5ld">bring up</a> - and misrepresent - my Stance on a completely different political Topic to make me seem bad.<br>
      No explanation needed, Staff simply accepts this Defamation.<br>
      <a href="https://imgur.com/a/3843uDC">Here</a> is the Clarification of my Position btw.<br>
      I did not post this in the Revolt Lounge though, as it would probably be considered political anyway.<br>
      Everything they disagree with is called "political" so it breaks a Rule, while their own Politics can stay. The Infractions seem completely arbitrary.
    </p>

    <h3>C. Racism</h3>
    <p>
      For being such tolerant Leftists, the Team does seem to accept Bigotry and Racism within its own Ranks quite often.<br>
      Like <a href="https://imgur.com/a/rGxZMMN">here,</a> for Example - where Apes and Black People are essentially equated.<br>
      The Excuse was that "its just a Joke", but according to that Logic the transphobic and homophobic Memes should be allowed to stay in the Revolt Lounge too. Theyre just Jokes after all.<br>
      This shows that the Social-Chauvinists Cries for "tolerance", "acceptance" and "inclusivity" are just empty Phrases. Such Incongruity between Words and Actions serves to undermine the Principles the Team claims to uphold.
    </p>

    <h3>D. Server Verification</h3>
    <p>
      On Revolt, you can <a href="https://developers.revolt.chat/faq/verification">verify your Servers.</a><br>
      As Insert said, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/QwEjDme"><i>"verification is meant for brands and projects."</i></a><br>
      So explain to me why <a href="https://imgur.com/a/XgIPFbH">an Anime Server</a> gets to be verified!
    </p>

    <h2>II. "Privacy-Friendly"</h2>
    <p>
      It is ridiculous that a "transparent" and "privacy-friendly" Project that "focuses only on the User" doesnt prioritize fundamental Aspects of Privacy, like End-to-End-Encryption and a Commitment to <a href="https://imgur.com/a/ZLX7Ico">staying 100% Free & Open-Source.</a><br>
      I dont think this Platform is any more Safe or Secure than Discord and I dont see a Reason why I should trust the Team to keep my Data safe.<br>
      Not to mention the Fact that we not only have to place our Trust in the Revolt Team but also in other Organizations, like Law Enforcement; and that this makes potential malicious Attacks on Revolt even more dangerous.
    </p>

    <h2>III. Immaturity</h2>
    <p>
      I would claim <a href="https://imgur.com/a/BG4HYXg">whatever this is</a> doesnt make the Platform, its Team or its Commitment to a welcoming Atmosphere and a safe Environment seem credible in any Way.<br><br>

      It seems that Revolt Staff doesnt even want to properly moderate their Platform.<br>
      With <a href="https://imgur.com/a/hpskRfe">Reasons like "being dumb",</a> Bans and Warns seem completely arbitrary and Moderators <a href="https://imgur.com/a/mpWL0j2">complaining</a> about having to moderate a Chat doesnt make it any better.<br>
      Some Users get banned or warned seemingly at random, while Team Members that are obviously breaking the Rules will never even face a simple Warning.<br><br>
      
      And when People ask simple Questions for Transparencys Sake, they get a Response like <a href="https://imgur.com/a/GJkziHK">this.</a>
    </p>

    <h2>To the Revolt Team</h2>
    <p>
      All of this raises the Question: Are these really just empty Phrases to appease a socially- and privacy-conscious Audience without real Intent or Effort to achieve meaningful Results?<br><br>
    
      I am not trying to justify anyones Behavior and I dont want any third Party to get banned.<br>

      I genuinely want Revolt to succeed and I believe it has significant Potential to do so.<br>
      I wish we could all work together to create a democratic and privacy-friendly Alternative to Discord!<br><br>
      
      However, I think this Potential is lost by the Actions described above.<br>
      Please, drop your Social-Chauvinism and your Hypocrisy. Learn to accept the Fact that youre not always right.<br>
      I have seen many Internet Communities break apart because their Moderators did not follow their own Guidelines.<br>
      Please redirect your Focus towards enhancing actual Privacy instead of "nice to have" but ultimately useless Features.<br><br> 

      And you should think about the Implications all of these Things have on your Project.<br>
      They might seem like small Things on their own, but together they shine a bad Light on Revolt.<br>
      This not only makes People want to stay away from this Platform,<br>
      but it makes the Moderation Team seem incompetent too.<br>
      This is not how you grow a Community.<br><br>
      
      Anyway, remember that we are all just little Ants on a giant Rock floating in Space. We should come together to make Life better for the vast Majority instead of fighting eachother.

    <h2>To Qyint</h2>
    <p>
      Greetings!<br><br>

      As we are already planning to host all of our Stuff on our own Servers,<br>
      I propose we self-host a Revolt Instance too.<br><br>

      Here is the first Screenshot of "Revolution":<br>
      <i>(Revolution on the Left, Revolt on the Right)</i><br>
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/HdHPK0i.png" style="width:100%;"></img><br><br>

      Revolution will likely be invite-only at first, just like our Cloud.<br>
      All Qyint Members, old World of War Players and other trusted Individuals will be invited.<br>
      We are doing this for Security and Legal Reasons.<br><br>

      If you have some Ideas for Features you would like to see added,<br>
      tell me and maybe i will try to add them!<br><br>

      The next General Assembly in 8 Days will decide if we are going to follow through with it.
