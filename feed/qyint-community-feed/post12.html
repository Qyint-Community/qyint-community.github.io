    <h2>Revolt Server Archival</h2>
    <p>
        About one Year ago, we stopped supporting and eventually deleted our Discord Server to focus entirely on Revolt.<br>
		Today, the General Assembly has decided that this was ultimately a Mistake.<br>
		We will archive the Revolt Server and remove all Users.<br><br>
		We no longer think that Revolt is a good Tool for us. It is centralized and its quite obvious that the Software running on the official Instance is not entirely open.<br>
		The Bridge is down and noone even noticed. This is a clear Sign that we dont need our Revolt Server anymore.<br><br>

		'Revolution', our self-hosted Instance of Revolt, will not happen for now.<br>
		A lot of Things wont happen, actually. We are experiencing a lot of Issues with our ISPs and are simply unable to host anything anymore, despite having the necessary Ressources.<br>
		We are considering renting a Server in Russia to bypass this.
