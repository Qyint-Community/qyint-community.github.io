    <h1>ANTI-DISCORD POLICY</h1>
    <h3>ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡³ [Community Updates] @ 30.05.2023</h3>
    <h2>The Discord Server will no longer be maintained.</h2>
    <p>
        Greetings,<br><br>
        More than Half of all Qyint Users are now on Revolt and Matrix.<br>
        Therefore, we will no longer maintain the Discord Server.<br>
        For now, it will still exist, and it will still be bridged to Revolt.<br>
        However, we will no longer push any Updates, nor will we actively Moderate the Discord.<br><br>
        This means:<br>
        - Voice Chats will be deleted, as they can no longer be moderated. (use Jitsi for VC)<br>
        - All Administrators and Community Managers have been kicked from the Discord for Security Purposes.<br>
        - We will no longer grant Roles to Discord Users.<br>
        - We will no longer add/remove/update any Features of the Discord, including Channels, Roles and Emojis.<br><br>
        Soon, we will also remove all Moderators and the Link to the Server;<br>and the entire Server in the Future.<br>
        We are also seeking to improve Quality of Life on Matrix, maybe with a Bridge from Revolt to Matrix directly.<br><br>
        This Decision may not be overwritten by the General Assembly, and may not be challenged democratically. It is final.<br><br>
        Long live the Revolution! We need Privacy and Freedom on the Internet!
    </p>
