    <h1>GOODBYE DISCORD!</h1>
    <h3>ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡³ [Community Updates] @ 19.06.2023</h3>
    <h2>The Discord Server will be archived.</h2>
    <p>
        Greetings!<br><br>
        The General Assembly has unanimously decided to archive the Discord.<br><br>
        You will no longer be able to interact with our Community through Discord.<br>
        All Channels have been set to private and the Bridges were taken down.<br>
        Administrators will still have Access to the Channels if we need anything.<br><br>
        The Matrix Space has also been removed,<br>
        as it isnt used by anyone and maintaining it would be a Waste of Time. 
    </p>
    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p>
        We have approved <a href="./post8.html">the new Manifesto</a>,<br>
        which outlines our Values and Goals.<br>
        Those of the Discord Administration contradict ours.<br>
        It is undemocratic and only interested in Profit,<br>
        instead of trying to provide a good Service.<br>
        The Discord Userbase is fed up with its Administration.<br>
        Most of our Users already use democratic and copyleft Alternatives,<br>
        so we dont see a Reason to keep the Discord running.<br>
        If you want to learn more, <a href="https://github.com/Qyint-Community/manifesto/blob/main/qyint-manifesto.txt">read our Manifesto</a> or ask us!
    </p>
    <h2>What now?</h2>
    <p>
        We will keep on doing our Stuff on Revolt.<br>
        Revolt is a copyleft Alternative to Discord.<br>
        It is not interested in removing good Features for Shareholder Profit,<br>
        and even if it were, everyone can make their own Copy.<br>
        It offers absolute Freedom and Privacy.<br>
        And it even has Features that Discord doesnt (or locks behind a Paywall)<br>
        like Color Gradients, animated Emojis everywhere, KaTeX Text Formatting,<br>
        Server Discovery for everyone, Server Identities, Banners and much more.<br>
        Allthough Revolt is not Feature Complete, the Developers are working hard<br>
        on updating it - and with the new Clients, Voice Chats and E2EE coming,<br>
        It will become a perfect Alternative to Discord.<br><br>
        <i>If you have any more Questions, you can always ask us!</i>
